# Mirage

Mirage is a mod that gives any enemy the ability to mimic a player's voice (fully synced to all players). **This mod is required by the host and on all clients.**

## Features (all features listed below are configurable)

- Every enemy can mimic the voice of any player currently in the game.
  - On spawn, each enemy chooses a player to always mimic the voice of.
  - Voices are synced to all players. This means everyone hears the same voice, the same words, at the same time.
  - Only masked enemies mimic voices by default, other enemies can be enabled via config.
- Masked enemies use the mimicking player's suit and cosmetics.
- Remove the mask from masked enemies.
- Remove the arms-out animation from masked enemies.
- Configuration is synced to all players (only the host's config is used).
- Adjustable spawn chance for masked enemies.
  - Calculates the spawn weights for each moon internally.
  - Default is set to spawn masked enemies at 2% for each moon.
  - Note: Setting the spawn-rate to 25% basically guarantees a spawn per round.
- Highly optimized for performance.

## I have a question. How can I ask for help?

If you have question, simply create a [new discussion](https://github.com/qwbarch/mirage/discussions) on GitHub.
I'll respond as soon as I'm available.

## I found a bug. Where can I report it?

For bugs, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/qwbarch/mirage/issues) on GitHub. Please mention the bug report is specifically for ``Lethal Company``.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Do I need Skinwalkers for this mod to work?

No, Mirage is a standalone mod. Installing both Mirage and Skinwalkers will result in Skinwalkers playing voices at the same time as Mirage.

#### Does every player need the same configuration?

No. Only the host's config is used.

#### How do I select which enemies get to mimic voices?

You will need to first host a game to generate ``Mirage.Enemies.cfg``.

#### Why is there a dependency on LethalSettings? I don't want to use it.

LethalSettings is used to provide what I want the intended user experience to be for adjusting per-player settings (values that are not synced by the host).  
For those who still don't want to use it either way, LethalSettings is a soft dependency and can be safely disabled.

If you have LethalSettings disabled, you and your users will need to modify your per-player settings by editing the ``Mirage/settings.json`` file,
located inside your Lethal Company directory (highly unrecommended to do this).

#### How do I access per-player settings?

</a>

#### Can I use MaskedEnemyOverhaul with this mod?

MaskedEnemyOverhaul will cause the masked enemy's suit and mimicking voice to not match.  
Use [MaskedEnemyOverhaulFork](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Coppertiel/MaskedEnemyOverhaulFork/) instead, with
the ``Dont Touch MaskedPlayerEnemy.mimickingPlayer`` configuration set to ``true``.

Unless you use the nameplate, fading mask, or zombie apocalypse feature(s), you probably don't need it though, since Mirage covers the rest of the features already.

#### Do I need DissonanceLagFix installed?

No. Mirage already applies the lag fix patch, since ``v1.0.16``.

#### Does this mod support cosmetics?

Yes, any mod that applies to masked enemies is compatible with Mirage.  
If the cosmetic mod you use does not support masked enemies, you will need to request the mod author to support it.

#### Does this mod use voice recognition and/or AI?

No. This was originally planned for the ``v2.0.0`` update, but the update has been dropped due to time constraints and life priorities.

#### What happened to the v2 (voice recognition + machine learning) update?

While 99% of the work has been done, [1DWalker](https://github.com/1DWalker) and I have other life responsibilities to prioritize. We can no longer justify spending all of our time
working on an unpaid passion project, and as such, have decided to drop the update altogether.  
To anyone who was excited for the v2 update: I apologize for the disappointment, and I also thank you for all the support.

## My other (unrelated) mods

- [AutoStart](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/AutoStart/) - A mod for developers. Helps you get into the game on multiple clients while also pulling the lever for you.
- [DriftwoodYeet](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/DriftwoodYeet/) - Yeet.

## Can I reupload the mod to Thunderstore?

No, reuploading the mod to Thunderstore is not permitted. If you are creating a modpack, please use the official mod.  
If you're making small changes for your friends, you will need to share the compiled ``.dll`` directly with them, and then import it locally.

## Credits

- [1DWalker](https://github.com/1DWalker) - Huge thanks for all the hard work put towards the v2 update. While the v2 update will no longer be released, I still want to point out that the update would not have even been possible without his work towards the machine-learning part of the codebase.  
- [IntegrityFate](https://integrityfate.com/) - Commissioned to create the new Mirage logo, putting his own spin on the design. You can find him here: https://integrityfate.com/
